## üéØ Configuration

You can customize Clover's behavior by editing `config.py`:

```python
# Animation timing
FPS = 60                    # Animation frame rate
IDLE_ACTION_INTERVAL = 5    # Seconds between idle actions
DANCE_DURATION = 60         # Seconds of dancing in idle sequence

# Visual settings
DEFAULT_SCALE = 1.0        # Default size multiplier
ANTI_ALIASING = True       # Smooth rendering
TRANSPARENCY = True        # Background transparency

# Behavior settings
FOLLOW_MOUSE_DISTANCE = 50 # Pixels distance when following mouse
WALK_SPEED = 2             # Pixels per frame when walking
IDLE_SEQUENCE_DELAY = 5    # Seconds before idle sequence starts
```

## Adding New Animations

To add new animations:

1. Create a new folder in the `Sprites` directory
2. Add numbered image files (0.png, 1.png, 2.png, etc.)
3. The animation will be automatically loaded on next startup

### Animation Categories

- **sitting**: Idle sitting animations
- **walking**: Movement animations (can have subdirectories for directions)
- **dancing**: Dance animations
- **lying**: Sleeping/lying down animations
- **nod**: Nodding animations
- **poses**: Special pose animations
- **characters_interactions**: Character interaction scenes

## Performance

The application is designed to be lightweight:

- Minimal CPU usage during idle periods
- Low memory footprint
- Non-intrusive desktop integration
- Optimized animation frame rates

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Clover doesn't appear**: Check if running as administrator is required
2. **High CPU usage**: Disable anti-aliasing in config.py
3. **Clover disappears**: Check if moved off-screen, restart application
4. **Menu doesn't work**: Try right-clicking directly on Clover's sprite
5. **Animation stuttering**: Close other resource-intensive applications

### Performance Tips
- Close unnecessary applications for smoother animation
- Disable anti-aliasing if experiencing performance issues
- Use smaller sizes (Normal/Large) for better performance on older systems
- Enable sleep mode when not actively watching Clover

### System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 7 or later
- **Linux**: X11 window system with compositing support
