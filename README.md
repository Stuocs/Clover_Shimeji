## Configuration


You can customize Clover's behavior by editing `config.py`:
  

```python

# Animation timing

DEFAULT_FRAME_RATE = 150          # ms per frame (â‰ˆ 6.66 FPS)
IDLE_ACTION_MIN_INTERVAL = 3000  # ms between idle actions
IDLE_ACTION_MAX_INTERVAL = 8000  # ms between idle actions
DANCE_SEQUENCE_DURATION = 60000  # ms of dancing in idle sequence

# Visual settings

DEFAULT_SCALE = 2.5               # Initial sprite scale
ANTI_ALIASING = True              # Smooth rendering
TRANSPARENT_BACKGROUND = True     # Transparent background

# Behavior settings

MOUSE_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 100   # Distance in px to consider the mouse "near"
MOUSE_FOLLOW_SPEED = 3            # Speed in px per update
MOUSE_FOLLOW_UPDATE_RATE = 50     # ms between position updates
IDLE_SEQUENCE_TRIGGER_TIME = 5000 # ms before starting idle sequence

```

  

## Adding New Animations

  

To add new animations:

  

1. Create a new folder in the `Sprites` directory

2. Add numbered image files (0.png, 1.png, 2.png, etc.)

3. The animation will be automatically loaded on next startup

- **sitting**: Idle sitting animations

- **walking**: Movement animations (can have subdirectories for directions)

- **dancing**: Dance animations

- **lying**: Sleeping/lying down animations

- **poses**: Special pose animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Clover doesn't appear**: Check if running as administrator is required

2. **Clover disappears**: Check if moved off-screen, restart application

3. **Menu doesn't work**: Try right-clicking directly on Clover's sprite

4. **Animation stuttering**: Close other resource-intensive applications
